This file is the client from TCP connection
where the GUI is created and the logic for AI game and networking
From __main__, first appear the menu_screen() where user choose which type of game he want to play
when the game is over he is returned to the menu again.
If he choose the computer partner, will be created a ComputerGame object and start the playGame function
but if he want to play with a person, then must run the server.py to accept connections, when are 2
users connected for a game, then will be send through socket the game object and is
updated the window.
